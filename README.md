# Explorer AutoMaximize

An AutoHotkey script that ensures Windows File Explorer maximizes when opening a folder while minimized. By default, Windows does not restore Explorer in this case, leaving it minimized.

## Features
- Automatically maximizes File Explorer when opening folders while minimized
- Lightweight and efficient
- Available as an AHK script or compiled EXE

## Installation
1. **Run the EXE (No installation required)**
   - Download `Restore Eplorer WIndow.exe` from [Releases]([https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Explorer-AutoMaximize/releases](https://github.com/Abel-Demere/Explorer-AutoMaximize/tree/main/releases))
   - Double-click to run in the background

2. **Run the AHK script (Requires AutoHotkey)**
   - Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
   - Download `Restore Eplorer WIndow.ahk`
   - Double-click to run

## How It Works
This script detects when a new folder is opened and checks if File Explorer is minimized. If it is, the script restores the window.

## Download
You can download the latest compiled EXE from the [Releases page](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Explorer-AutoMaximize/releases](https://github.com/Abel-Demere/Explorer-AutoMaximize/tree/main/releases)).
